# Twitter_Management_System-FYP
This is my Final year project with name Twitter Management System, in which Users may simply check and keep track on their Twitter followers using the website Twitter Management System. The site offers real-time data on the amount of followers gained or lost, as well as comprehensive insights into follower demographics and engagement levels, thanks to its user-friendly layout and effective analytics tools. Also, users can keep track of their unfollowers and take proactive measures to improve their Twitter visibility. For social media managers, influencers, and anybody else trying to develop a loyal and active Twitter following, Twitter Management System is a vital tool. It is also used for following and stats. 


# Abstract
Users may simply check and keep track on their Twitter followers using the website Twitter Management System. The site offers real-time data on the amount of followers gained or lost, as well as comprehensive insights into follower demographics and engagement levels, thanks to its user-friendly layout and effective analytics tools. Also, users can keep track of their unfollowers and take proactive measures to improve their Twitter visibility. For social media managers, influencers, and anybody else trying to develop a loyal and active Twitter following, Twitter Management System is a vital tool. It is also used for following and stats.

# Problem Statement
Twitter users can track their followers, un-followers, and statistics with the aid of the tool known as Twitter Management System. Twitter is a well-known social networking site where users can follow other people's profiles to communicate with them. Users can unfollow profiles for a number of reasons, such as indifference or a change in the posted content, but they can also do so. Knowing when someone unfollows them is crucial for users who want to monitor their follower count and engagement. By giving users a tool to keep track of their Twitter followers and receive alerts when someone unfollows them, Twitter Management System seeks to solve this issue. Users of the tool will be able to keep tabs on changes in their follower count, see a list of their Twitter, and get notifications when someone does so. Following is also a feature of our project. So, we are developing a website which will use for stats of someone’s twitter account and gain organic followers. On social media platforms such as Twitter, public figures regular people, celebrities, and influencers typically attempt to gain thousands of followers. However, it is difficult to gain active followers on any social media platform, particularly Twitter, which imposes numerous limitations and restrictions. A user can only follow 30–70 followers in a row on Twitter, after which Twitter restricts the user’s maximum number of followers for a period of time. Most individuals attempt to gain followers by purchasing them through bots, but these followers do not interact means those are only dummy for showoff. Twitter does not disclose any statistics aside from the following and followers of a profile. Therefore, we are attempting to resolve this issue to make it easier for people to gain access to large numbers of followers and maintain statistics. And because of these constraints, people (users) frequently attempt to abandon or minimize their use of Twitter. According to our project given timeline we almost fulfilled our desired task in which there is include development part, and we almost complete the frontend development

# Proposed Solution
To create a Twitter management system website, we need to use the Twitter API to access the list of followers and compare it with the current list of followers to identify any changes.
Here are the steps to propose the solution of our Twitter management system:
1. Create a Twitter Developer account and register an application to obtain API keys and access tokens.
2. Use a programming language like Python to write a script that connects to the Twitter API using the API keys and access tokens.
3. Use the API to get the list of followers for a specific Twitter account.
4. Save the list of followers in a cloud database.
5. Set up a system to run the script periodically (e.g., once a day).
6. Each time the script runs, it should compare the current list of followers with the previous list of followers.
7. Identify any users who have unfollowed the account and update the cloud database or file with this information.
8. Generate a report or send an alert to the account owner with details on the users who have unfollowed.
9. With this tool, Twitter users can keep track of who unfollows them and take necessary action, such as reviewing their content and engagement strategies, to retain followers.
